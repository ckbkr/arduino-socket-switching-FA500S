An A configured switch will react to the B signal for turning on

Configuration:

Socket 1: B
Socket 2: C

With A ON: Both turn on
With A OFF: Both turn off

With B ON: Socket 1 turns on
With B OFF: Socket 1 turns off

With C ON: Socket 2 turns on
With C OFF: Socket 2 turns off

With D ON: Both turn on
With D OFF: Both turn off

Arduino should have a cap on the reset to filter out software resets from the serial port, otherwise it will reboot everytime a serial console is opened
